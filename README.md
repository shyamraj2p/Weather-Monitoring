# Weather-Monitoring
This project is a real-time data processing system for monitoring weather conditions in major Indian cities. It retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, performs aggregations, and visualizes the results.

## File Structure
- `alert_manager.py`: Manages alert thresholds for weather conditions.
- `db_manager.py`: Handles database initialization and connections.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains dependencies for the project.
- `weather_aggregates.py`: Computes daily weather summaries and statistics.
- `weather_data.db`: SQLite database for storing weather data.
- `weather_monitor.py`: Continuously fetches weather data for specified cities.
- `weather_visualization.py`: Visualizes weather data and summaries.

## Docker
To run the application in a container:

Build the Docker image:- docker build -t weather-monitoring-system .
Run the container:- docker run -d -p 5000:5000 weather-monitoring-system

## Usage
The system will retrieve and store weather data at configurable intervals.
Alerts will be triggered based on defined thresholds.
Visualizations can be generated by running weather_visualization.py
